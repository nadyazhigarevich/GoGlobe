# GoGlobe — AI-Powered Relocation Ecosystem

GoGlobe is a comprehensive **Relocation as a Service (RaaS)** platform designed to transform international migration from a fragmented, high-risk process into a structured and predictable digital experience. The ecosystem shifts the focus from simple service aggregation to full process orchestration with guaranteed outcomes.

## Project Overview
The platform addresses the psychological and financial complexities of relocation by providing a data-driven path from initial planning to full integration in a new country.

## Key Features
*   **AI Simulation Engine:** A predictive module that models lifestyle scenarios, cost-of-living forecasts, and success probabilities based on millions of data points.
*   **Service Orchestration:** End-to-end management of the migration funnel, including visa documentation, verified housing, and social infrastructure integration.
*   **Strategic Market Analysis:** Integration of Blue Ocean Strategy and Foresight analysis to identify untapped market opportunities.
*   **Quality & Compliance:** Process optimization governed by **ITIL** and **CMMI** maturity levels to ensure high Service Level Agreement (SLA) standards.

## System Architecture
The project follows the **Zachman Framework** and is modeled across three architectural layers:
1.  **Business Layer:** Value proposition mapping and Unit Economics (LTV, CAC, ROI).
2.  **Application Layer:** Orchestration modules and AI-driven questionnaire engines.
3.  **Technology Layer:** Multi-layer infrastructure modeled via **ArchiMate**.

## Methodology & Tools
*   **Modeling:** BPMN 2.0 (Mermaid), ArchiMate, Wardley Mapping.
*   **Frameworks:** Zachman, ITIL, CMMI, Business Model Canvas.
*   **Analytics:** Unit Economics modeling, COCOMO II (effort estimation).
*   **Management:** Agile (Kanban/Scrum).
